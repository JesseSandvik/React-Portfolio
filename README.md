This is a personal portfolio website I've built for my own personal marketing.

This is a front end project built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, React, React Hooks, and React Router.

This was a great exercise in developing a deeper skillset with the React library, as well as React Hooks, React Router, and this was also my first project utilizing SASS.

I really worked on developing a deeper understanding of the power both CSS and SASS provide, and I even took some chances and really pulled myself from my comfort zone in some places.

This is a work in progress and will likely remain so. Near future additions will include a dedicated projects page, where I can showcase some of my deployed projects, as well as a blog page where I can share some of my thoughts and insights as I grow as a developer.
